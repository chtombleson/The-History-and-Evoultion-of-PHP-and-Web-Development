# The History and Evoultion of PHP and Web Development
## By Christopher Tombleson <chris@cribznetwork.com>

### Preamble
I will be exploring the evoultion of web development and PHP
from it's humble beginnings as some C based cgi script though
till today.

I will also explore some other languages that have been prevalent
in the evoultion, expansion and dominance of the web in our everyday
life.

I'm searching the web and asking people gathering information about
the evoultion of web development but more so the evoultion of PHP.


### About the Author
I've developing and writing web applications since 2008 mostly in PHP
but I've work with Perl, Ruby and sadly that evil thing we call .NET

My intrigue for web development and programming come from me asking myself
the question "How does the web work? How can I make something cool? How does facebook work?".

So I started the way many people do which is static HTML... Which is cool for a week, then
your like "There has to be an easier way?". Easier way === PHP, PHP 4 to be exact. Lets
just say I don't miss those days.

Nowadays I'm an advide opensource developer and contributor, mostly to PHP projects. Although
I'm knowledgable in many different languages such Perl, Ruby, Python, Javascript, C++, Lua....
The list goes on.

But for the purposes of this document I will be focusing mainly on PHP but will hit on some
Perl (because it's awesome), Ruby, maybe some Python and some Javascript, node.js.


### The Web - Early Days
From the days of the Gopher protocol and text based browsing to graphical interface and HTML/HyperText.
The early 80's and though to the mid 90's the progression from terminal based text browsers to Netscape Navigator &
Internet Explorer (evil).

The World Wide Web (good old www) invented & developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 at CERN and also created the worlds
first website, [info.cern.ch] (http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)[1,2].

But as most of us know the web is nothing without a protocol to deliver the content, no worries the Sir Tim Berners-Lee also
create the tools that really made the web such as the HTTP protocol (HyperText Transfer Protocol), HTML (HyperText Markup Language),
the first web browser called World Wide Web and don't forget about the first HTTP server[3].

For more info about the world first website: [http://info.cern.ch/] (http://info.cern.ch/).

If your like me your probably wondering how did we go from the worlds first website to the websites of today...

### The Birth of CGI (Common Gateway Interface)
The birth of CGI finally gave us away of run a program/script on a web server and then render the output of these
scripts and send it back to the client.

The language of choice back when CGI was released in 1993[4] was Perl.


### The rise of server side languages in the web
From 1993 with the release of the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) to the early 2000's
many new programming languages most scripting languages were born such as PHP, Python, Ruby and
also new versions of those Languages.

Here is a list of release years[5]:
 * 1993 - Common Gateway Interface
 * 1994 - Perl 5 (still going strong after 19 years) & Python 1.0
 * 1995 - PHP 2 (Known at the time as Personal Home Page), Ruby
 * 1996 - ASP 1.0, Python 1.4
 * 1998 - PHP 3, Java Servlet 2.1
 * 1999 - Java Servlet 2.2
 * 2000 - PHP 4, ASP 3.0, Python 2.0
 * 2001 - Java Servlet 2.3, Python 2.2
 * 2002 - ASP.Net 1.0 (Evil)
 * 2003 - ASP.Net 1.1 (Still Evil), Java Servlet 2.4, Python 2.3
 * 2004 - PHP 5, Ruby on Rails 0.5.0, Python 2.4
 * 2005 - ASP.Net 2, Java Servlet 2.5, Python 2.5, Ruby on Rail 1.0.0
 * 2006 - Ruby on Rails 1.1.0
 * 2007 - ASP.Net 3.5, Ruby on Rails 1.2.0

As you can see in the time line above the whole web exploded on to the scene in a big way in 1993.
